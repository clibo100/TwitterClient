On a scale of 1 to 6, I give this code a rating of 5.5 based on the following criteria:

1  I was not able to compile the program due to insufficient information in the README.md file.

2  At least one of the programs has syntax errors and does not compile

3  The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

4  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.

Specifically:

5  The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not perform according to the documentation or does not comply with Chapman Coding Standards.

Specifically:

6  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented, following the Chapman Coding Standards.

Suggestions for improving the code (for extra credit!):
* Get the screen name from api instead of having user enter it
* Update readme to include specific instructions on installing dependencies
* I wish the window was bigger
* Make it more robust to errors, ex entering pin incorrectly causes whole thing to crash (without telling user to restart it)
* Document all the functions to fully comply with Chapman Coding Standards
