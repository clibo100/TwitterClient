TweetTeamRocket, a Twitter client

We have created a custom client  for the popular social networking site Twitter that demonstrates the use of the Twitter API (Application Programming Interface). Our program connects our client to the twitter API, to read and send out tweets. This program makes a contribution to the field by utilizing the features given by Twitter and its vast options of use for its API. This is relevant because of Twitter’s popularity in today’s fast-past, technologically advanced society. Our program allows us to enhance a technology  that is already widely used and that will only benefit from the added options. All of this will relates  to our study of networking because of the novel way  we utilize the API to send and receive tweets. For our creation process we worked from the ground up by developing  the base function work before adding extra features Our ultimate goal is to add a Graphical User Interface(GUI) . In developing this program we utilized the skills we gained in class while being pushed  to further expand our understanding of computer networking and coding.
